## Northwood Labs

We're a tiny company based in Colorado :us:, who thinks that software engineering :woman_technologist:, site reliability :mechanical_arm:, operations :whale:, and cybersecurity :ninja: are all parts of the same whole. We want to empower teams to build quality software and reliable services :1st_place_medal:, teach where there are knowledge gaps :man_teacher:, and make it possible for every user to have access to the best in security :dependabot:.

Historically, most of the tools built to address these areas have done a poor job of integrating across all relevant disciplines :broken_heart:, and can also cost a small fortune :moneybag: in order to help teams ensure their products and services are well-built, reliable, and secure.

We believe that all of this can be made better, and we intend to try.
